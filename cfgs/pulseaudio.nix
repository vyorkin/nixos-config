    # It seems like the Scarlett reports a stereo mic input,
    # regardless of the actual capabilities of the mic.
    # This can cause a variety of effects, such as a 100% left
    # channel recording, distortion or, in my case, a static noise on
    # the right channel (might have been the 48V phantom power).
    # Creating a remapped pulseaudio input was the most elegant solution.

    # The following extra config lines tell pulseaudio to create a
    # remapped microphone source that only contains the left channel of
    # the original and is thus a mono source. Make sure to adjust the
    # master option according to the output from pacmd and donâ€™t forget to
    # remove the brackets! The second line is optional and automatically sets the
    # default source to our new redirected source.
